# [fit] Time to try it!
# [fit] What we did to setup AMP ⚙️

---

# [fit] Step 1
# [fit] Get the AMP plugin 🔌

---

![inline](assets/amp-plugin.png)

# [fit] We installed: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/amp/

---

# [fit] Step 2
# [fit] Tweak plugin 🔧

---

# [fit] Modifying output


We use Timber (Twig) and a semi-custom page builder to build pages (We do not use the default WordPress editor).

Fixing this was actually very easy thanks to the dedicated AMP page templates 📄

# [fit] Was this worth the time invested? 🤔

Maybe 😬. **Our** site doesn't host the right content.

---

# [fit] Should **you** use AMP? 🤔
YES!!! If **your** site does host the right content.
