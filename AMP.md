Smooth scrolling |
Reduced page 'jumping' while assets load |
**Apparently** it's not hard to get started |
Gain a bit of Google goodwill |
Google are paying for your traffic |

![inline](assets/amp-plugin.png)

# [fit] We installed: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/amp/

---

# [fit] Step 2
# [fit] Tweak plugin 🔧

---

# [fit] Modifying output


We use Timber (Twig) and a semi custom page builder to build pages (We do not use the default WordPress editor).

Fixing this was actually very easy thanks to dedicated AMP page templates 📄
